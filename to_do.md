##Current state
The app is still on the early stages of its development. So far, the sequencing simulator works properly. Besides, the initial structure for metagenomics analysis works. The program now is suited to analyze multiple samples, but it is till has lots of stuff missing: lots of hardcoded paths, must work out IO; It needs a minimal frontend interface; It must be refactored to a sync app.
